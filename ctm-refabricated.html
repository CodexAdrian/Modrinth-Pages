<p>Welcome to CTM Refabricated, a port of ConnectedTexturesMod for Fabric which is a port of the ConnectedTexturesMod (a mouthful, I know)</p>
<p>CTM Refabricated allows resource packs to add connected textures, emissive rendering, and much more. A resource pack which adds these effects to vanilla, and some select mods, can be found <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/ctp" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note: CTM Refabricated does not support the Optifine CTM format, for that, use Continuity.</p>
<p>In compliance with the GPL license, I state the following:</p>
<p>The original mod can be found <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ctm-fabric">here</a>.</p>
<p>This mod was forked from the source code found <a href="https://github.com/PepperCode1/ConnectedTexturesMod-Fabric">here.</a></p>
<p>My changes consist of porting the mod to 1.18.2 and 1.19 Fabric and editing code where necessary to use the updated methods in those versions</p>
